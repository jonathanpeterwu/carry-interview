# Carry Fullstack Interview

## Overview

This project is designed to assess your full-stack development skills using NextJS and TailwindCSS. You will be responsible for implementing a stock search and purchase workflow, integrating with 3rd party libraries to fetch stock and performance data, as needed and if time permits.

The goal is to create an application where users can search for stocks, view performance data, and simulate stock purchases. This exercise will test your ability to work across the stack, from frontend interactions to backend API structure.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies
3. Start the development server

## Project Requirements

- **Stock Search Functionality:** Implement a search feature that allows users to find stocks by ticker symbol.

- **Purchase Simulation:** Create a workflow that lets users simulate stock purchases, including specifying the number of shares. Do not worry about edge cases around account balance, selling, etc. The backend can be stubbed with a console log or something similar.

- **Your Call:** Add any additional features (or talk about them if running out of time) on what else could be added.

## Recommended Libraries

1. [node-yahoo-finance-2](https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2)
2. [Tanstack Query](https://github.com/tanstack/query)
3. [react-chart-js-2](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2)

## API Endpoint

A test API endpoint has been provided to give an example on how the Next API functionality works.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality:** Search and mock order placement should work as expected
- **Organization/Quality:** Ensure code is structured well and extensible for future use
- **Design Decisions:** Ability to implement a reasonable design without much direction and the limited time
